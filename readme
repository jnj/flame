Implementation Notes:

* Parser generates random "encouragement" to help motivate error-prone coders.
* The compiler does not do array bounds checking, which is not worth the
  performance hit.
* Optimizations: Not really.
    - Does algebraic identity stuff in the parser.
    - Does mul/div by powers of 2 using shifts.
    - Always keeps DISPLAY in %o5.
