This directory contains tests for flamelex.py.

Here are the files:

   *.flm      - FLAME source files. Used as the test input

   *.exp      - Expected output file.  Your lexer should
                produce exactly this output (with the exception
                the token names which you are allowed to define).
                The .exp was generated by Dave's implementation
                of lexer.
    
   test1.py   - Run this program to run all of the tests.

   test1.tar  - Unix tar file containing all of the test files.

To test your scanner, copy all of the *.flm and *.exp files to
your own private test directory.  Copy the test1.py script to
your own directory.  Make sure that the file 'flamelex.py' and 
'plex.py' are in this directory as well.

Now, just type 

    % python test1.py

If all is well, you'll get output like this:

**** Running tests for Project 1 ****
Test symbols ............. passed
Test keywords ............ passed
Test numbers ............. passed
Test string .............. passed
Test comment ............. passed
